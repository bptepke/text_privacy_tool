The 2 plot directories contain stylometric plots according to the methode developed by Mendenhall.

Plot 1 shows word frequency as a function of word length. Plot 2 shows the same, but on a logarithmic scaling. For each, the red and black lines show the stylometric writer invariant for to halves of the novel, The Box Car Children, showing that the authors style matches itself with independent writing samples. The green line shows Thomas Paine's Common Sense for comparison, showing that his style differs from the author of the Box Car Children. The blue line shows the result for The Box Car Children when articles, which carry little meaning, are removed, showing that an authors style can be altered.
